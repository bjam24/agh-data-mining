# Data Mining ðŸ“Š
## Description
These projects were made for the Data Mining course at the AGH UST in 2024. I am mostly proud of solved lab 1 and lab 2, because they were the most ambitious projects to do with
a usage of my favourite language Python. There are also other projects done in MATLAB and Statistica.
